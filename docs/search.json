Although I do not own one as my there are people in my family that are afraid of cats, I have many cat soft toys at home which I have collected over the years. I have a collection of over 30 cat soft toys ranging from small to large that I see next to my bed every night when I sleep."

It’s role was to collect dirty bottles of dangerous chemicals and bring them to a station where they are cleaned to avoid scientists having to manually carry dangerous substances around the laboratory.\n\n\nI have learned many useful skills from this FYP project including:\n\nProgramming in C (Arduino)\nElectrical wiring\nTime management skills\nProject organisational skills\nTeamwork skills\n\nOne very interesting thing about my FYP project was learning how to use mecanum wheels for a moving robot. It caught my interest as I have never thought that a wheeled robot could have that much flexibility in its movement before. I made full use of it in my project to ensure smooth and efficient movement."

    "text": "I have chosen to use ChatGPT due to its popularity and familiarity in using it to assist in past assignments. Additionally, Github Copilot is constantly active on RStudio and I take full advantage of its suggestions to help to complete code faster and more efficiently.\nAlthough I did not use it explicitly for this assignment, I used it a fair bit for helping to complete the previous exercises during the lecture, namely for assisting in debugging or formatting issues.\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\n\nUsing ChatGPT to help with cleaning and formatting of styling.\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\n\nUsing ChatGPT to help with opening a hyperlink in a new tab.\n\n\nThe benefit of using these GenAI tools is helping to code faster due to the automatic suggestions by Copilot as well as the ability for ChatGPT to assist with debugging and formatting issues.\n\n\nOne of the challenges I faced using ChatGPT was its tendancy to attempt to use html formatting for helping to solve the issues that I was having rather than Quarto. As such, I had to specify that I wanted solutions in Quarto in order for it to provide the correct code.\n\n\nI believe that going forward, the use of such GenAI tools will be beneficial to me in the long term as I will be able to use them effectively to both learn and produce more efficient code."
