title: "FYP Project"

Previously, I was studying in Ngee Ann Polytechnic where I pursued a diploma in Automation & Mechatronics Systems.

\

My FYP was to construct and program a robot vehicle for use in a science lab. It's role was to collect dirty bottles of dangerous chemicals and bring them to a station where they are cleaned to avoid scientists having to manually carry dangerous substances around the laboratory.

\

I have learned many useful skills from this FYP project including:

1. Programming in C (Arduino)
2. Electrical wiring
3. Time management skills
4. Project organisational skills
5. Teamwork skills

One very interesting thing about my FYP project was learning how to use [mecanum wheels](https://seamonsters-2605.github.io/archive/mecanum/){target="_blank"} for a moving robot. It caught my interest as I have never thought that a wheeled robot could have that much flexibility in its movement before. I made full use of it in my project to ensure smooth and efficient movement.
