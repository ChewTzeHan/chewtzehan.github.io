One interesting thing about me is that I really like *cats*. Although I do not own one as my there are people in my family that are afraid of cats, I have many *cat soft toys* at home which I have collected over the years. I have a collection of over 30 cat soft toys ranging from small to large that I see next to my bed every night when I sleep.
